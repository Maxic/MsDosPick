# Usage:

- Install all requirements with pip
- Run ia configure and login with your internet archive account
    - If you down have an account, create one here: TODO LINK
- Run pick_game

# Notes:

IA is not required, if you do not have it configured or don't have internet, the script uses the included JSON file (msdoslib.json) to pick a title.
